        <p>Tetris (Russian: Тетрис[a]) is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving tetrominoes, which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. Though the core gameplay has remained consistent, specific game mechanics between different Tetris variants have differed, with some changes becoming standard over time. Versions have been released for personal computers (PC), consoles, and mobile platforms. <i>From wikipedia</i></p>

        <p>Sudoku (/suːˈdoʊkuː, -ˈdɒk-, sə-/; Japanese: 数独, romanized: sūdoku, lit. 'digit-single'; originally called Number Place)[1] is a logic-based,[2][3] combinatorial[4] number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.<i> From wikipedia</i></p>
